# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise decided to produce a play entitled Fever. In order to raise the money she created a Kickstarter campaign to fund the play. She was able to come very close to her fundraising goal. She then wanted to know how other kickstarter campaigns did in their campaigns. This writer used Excel to help Louise understand how these other campaigns performed in comparison to their launch dates and fundraising goals. 

### Purpose

There are two purposes of this project. The first is to determine which plays reached their goals according to their launch dates. This can tell Louise the best times to launch a play for the best chance of success. The second purpose is to compare the difference between fundraising goals and actual fundraising outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart labeled "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" details how kickstarter campaigns performed during each month of the year. There are three different results; successful, failed and canceled kickstarter campaigns. The blue line represents successful campaigns. The orange line represents failed campaigns, or those who did not reach their goals. The gray line represents canceled campaigns.

Based on the data, the most successful campaigns were launched in May through August. The most successful campaigns within the failed category also were launched May through August, There was no real change in campaigns that were canceled. They remained nearly the same throughout the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data in this chart indicates that the plays were were most successful had smaller goals. 76% of projects whose goals were less than $1000 were successful. 73% of the projects with goals of $1000 to $4999 were successful as well. As the fundraising goal increases the percentage of projects that were successful goes down for the most part. Only 13% of the projects with a goal over $50,000 were successful.

Similarly, the percentage of projects who failed to reach their goals go up as the goals increased. 24% of the projects with a goal of less than $1000 failed. As the goal increased so does the percentage of those that failed with a few exceptions. 88% of projects whose goal was over $50,000 failed. 

There were zero canceled projects in this analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did not have many challenges in the Outcomes by Launch Date. I was able to input my formula to get the desired result. However, I had a lot of trouble using the Countifs function for the Outcomes Based on Goals. I have limited experience with Excel, so I spent more time using outside resources to learn how to use the function. After I felt comfortable I ran the formula. However, I still received the wrong result as I entered some information incorrectly. I found the error and made corrections.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The two conclusions this writer can draw about Outcomes Based on Launch Date are:

More plays are launched in the months of May through August than the rest of the year. There are more successful funding campaigns than there are failed campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The Outcomes Based on Goals suggests that campaigns are more likely to be successful if the goals are smaller. Campaigns with larger goals were more likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset is limited by the number of campaigns. This particular analysis focused only on kickstart campaigns involving plays. Other types of projects such as books, films and television were left out of this analysis.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

This particular kickstarter campaign involved plays. However, there were kickstarter campaigns for films, television projects and more. A chart or table could be created to compare the success or failure of other types of projects. The data could also be sorted by country. Using this data one could chart the differences of goals based on various countries and compare.
